# Botium Toys – Security Audit & Risk Assessment

This project is part of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. It focuses on assessing the security posture of Botium Toys by reviewing assets, evaluating controls, and performing a risk assessment.

## 📄 Project Files
- **Scope, Goals, and Risk Assessment Report** – Includes asset inventory, goals of the audit, risk scoring, and control gaps.  
- **Control Categories** – Breaks down administrative, technical, and physical controls.  
- **Controls & Compliance Checklist** – Evaluates whether Botium Toys meets key compliance requirements.

## 🧠 Key Skills Demonstrated
| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Security Auditing | Performed a full review of controls, compliance, and asset management. |
| Risk Assessment | Assigned risk scores and evaluated threats, vulnerabilities, and impact. |
| Compliance Analysis | Evaluated PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC requirements. |
| Control Evaluation | Identified missing administrative, technical, and physical controls. |
| Documentation | Produced professional security reports and structured audit findings. |

## 🛠 Tools & Frameworks Used
- **NIST CSF** – Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover  
- **Compliance Frameworks:** PCI DSS, GDPR, SOC 1 & SOC 2  
- **Risk Scoring Models**

## 📊 Summary of Findings
- Assets were not fully inventoried or classified.  
- Lack of encryption for credit card data.  
- No intrusion detection system (IDS).  
- Inadequate access controls (least privilege not implemented).  
- No disaster recovery plan or backup systems.  
- Employees had broad access to sensitive data.  
- Password policy was outdated and unenforced.  
- Physical security was strong (locks, CCTV, fire detection).  

## 🔐 Risk Score
**8 / 10 (High)**  
Due to missing controls, weak access policies, and compliance gaps.

## ✔️ Recommendations
- Implement least privilege and role-based access controls.  
- Deploy encryption for sensitive credit card data.  
- Add IDS/IPS and centralized password management.  
- Create a disaster recovery plan and backup policy.  
- Update password requirements and automate enforcement.  
- Classify and inventory all assets to strengthen the Identify function of NIST CSF.
